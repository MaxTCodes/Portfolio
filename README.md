# Welcome to Max's Portfolio Source!
The design is highly inspired from [sassafras](https://github.com/brandonsaldan/sassafras), and originally was a fork of that repo, until I didn't like the preformance metrics and rewrote it to react. I also wrote [an API](https://github.com/MaxTCodes/Portfolio-Api) for this, because I got annoyed at the preformance of last.fm's API. All of this will stay open-source, so feel free to come back later!
